   with the minimum rights identified in the Restricted Rights provisions, the 
   minimum rights shall prevail.

5. No Other License. No rights or licenses are granted by AMD under this
   License, expressly or by implication, with respect to any proprietary
   information or patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual 
   property right owned or controlled by AMD, except as expressly provided in 
   this License.

6. Additional Licenses. DISTRIBUTION OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE WITH AN OPERATING

   ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, CURRENTNESS, OR OTHERWISE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN 
   INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY AMD OR AMD'S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL 
   CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY. SHOULD

   REPRESENTATIVE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
   CORRECTION. THE SOFTWARE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN MEDICAL, LIFE SAVING OR

   USE THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION, BREACH OR DEFAULT, INCLUDING 
   THOSE ARISING FROM INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, 
   TRADEMARK, COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, BY AMD, EVEN IF

   OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION 
   OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE 
   LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. AMD will not be liable for: 1)

   you based on any third party claim. In no event shall AMD's total liability 
   to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, 
   tort (including negligence) or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you for 
   the Software.
