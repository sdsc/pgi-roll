    international treaty provisions.  The Licensors retain all right, title
    and interest to, and ownership of, the Software, including the copy 
    provided herein, and reserve all rights not expressly granted in this ELA.

2)  Granting of License

2A) Except as set forth in Sections 3, 4 and 5 below, under the terms and
    conditions of this ELA, You are hereby granted a limited, revocable,
    nontransferable, and nonexclusive license, without the right to sublicense
    or distribute, to use the Software subject to the restrictions and other
    terms within. That use must be

            license has been lawfully entered into, and

    Except as set forth in Section 2B and Section 2C below, any other use of
    the Software is strictly prohibited.

2B) If the Software is any version of the Software other than the "Developer"
    version of the Software, this Section 2B, and not Section 2C below, shall
    apply: You may distribute an end-user application that You build with the
    Software that provides significant functionality distinct from that
    included with the Software ("End-User Application") to users within Your
    organization as well as third party users outside Your organization
    ("Sublicensees") for only such uses and/or Target Systems for which the
    Software was designed and intended. You agree that any sublicense shall
    not relieve You from Your obligations under this ELA.  The Software
    includes the run-time files, libraries and executables ("Run-Time Files")
    that are bound into Your application by the linker or otherwise required
    by Your application.  You may also distribute separate dynamically-linked
    or executable Run-Time Files required during the execution of Your End-User
    Application.  Whenever an End-User Application is used internally within
    Your organization or by outside third parties, You shall contractually
    require that all Sublicensees: (1) provide written or clickwrap assent to
    the license terms under a written, legally enforceable agreement that has
    the effect of protecting the Software and the rights of NVIDIA under terms
    no less restrictive than this Agreement; and (2) abide by the following
    restrictions:
    (i)     they shall not use the "PGI", "The Portland Group", or
            "NVIDIA", name, logo, or trademarks in marketing the End-User 
            Application without prior written permission from NVIDIA,
    (ii)    they will maintain a valid copyright on the End-User
            Application,
    (iii)   they are prohibited from modifying, adapting, translating,
            reverse engineering, de-compiling, disassembling, or creating

            nor may they attempt in any manner to obtain the source code,
    (iv)    they disclaim any and all warranties on behalf of NVIDIA and
            other applicable licensors,
    (v)     they disclaim, to the maximum extent permitted by law, NVIDIA's,
            its affiliated companies and its licensors' liability for all
            damages, direct or indirect, incidental or consequential, that
            may arise from any use of the Software,
    (vi)    they agree not to export the Software, directly or indirectly, 
            in violation of U.S. export control laws or any export or 
            import regulations in other countries,
    (vii)   they will, without limitation, indemnify, hold harmless, and
            defend NVIDIA and other applicable Licensors and their 
            respective affiliates and suppliers from and against any and 
            all claims, lawsuits, costs, and expenses, including attorney's 
            fees, that arise or result from their use or distribution of 
            the End-User Application, and
    (viii)  they shall strictly prohibit the further distribution of the 
            Run-Time Files by the user of the End-User Application. 
            Notwithstanding the above, the only Run-Time Files that may 
            be distributed as noted in this Section 2B are in the folders 
            or directories whose names begin with "REDIST".

2C) If the Software is a "Developer" version of the Software, so identified,
    this Section 2C, and not Section 2B above, shall apply: You may only use an
    End-User Application on the same computer system on which You installed the
    Software and compiled such End-User Application.  You do not have any
    rights to distribute, deploy, or otherwise transfer the End-User
    Application to any other computer system, over a network, or to
    Sublicensees.  You may not allow anyone other than You to use the End-User
    Application.

    INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER
    PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THIS ELA OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO

    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TO THE
    EXTENT THAT NVIDIA MAY BE HELD LEGALLY LIABLE TO YOU BY A COURT OF
    COMPETENT JURISDICTION UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
    THEORY, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF THE LICENSORS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE
    APPLICABLE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
    (US$1,000), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

    NVIDIA has no obligation to support or provide any updates of the
    Software.
