            or indirect, incidental or consequential, that may arise from any
            use of the Software,
    (vii)   shall not export the Software, directly or indirectly, in violation
            of U.S. export control laws or any export or import regulations in
            other countries,
    (viii)  shall strictly prohibit the further distribution of the Run-Time
            Files by users of an End-User Application, and
    (ix)    shall include the following notice in modifications and derivative
            works of sample source code distributed: "This software contains
            source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation."

2C) Pre-Release Software

    Software versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as
    "Pre-Release", may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design
    flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility,
    availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
    NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a Pre-Release version may result in
    unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable
    damage or loss.

    You may use a Pre-Release version internally, at your own risk,
    understanding that Pre-Release versions are not intended for distribution
    or for use in production or business-critical systems.

    Only you may use an application compiled with a Pre-Release version. You do
    not have any rights to distribute or otherwise transfer an application
    compiled with a Pre-Release version.

    NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any
    Pre-Release Software. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and
    terminate the availability of a Pre-Release version at any time without
    liability.

3)  Software from Microsoft
    
    You acknowledge that as part of the Software you may receive Run-Time
    Files in the form of Microsoft Foundation Classes ("MFCs"), Active

    any other provision of this ELA, you acknowledge and agree:
    (A)     that you have a limited right to use the Microsoft Distributable
            Code to design, develop, or test for use with the Software only,
    (B)     that you or your end-users of the Microsoft Distributable Code
            may only use it to create programs that run natively on
            Microsoft platforms, and
    (C)     to the following restrictions: you and your end-users:
            (i)     will not alter any copyright, trademark, patent, or other
                    legal notice or disclaimer in the Microsoft Distributable
                    Code,
            (ii)    will not run the Microsoft Distributable Code on a
                    platform other than a Microsoft platform, and
            (iii)   will not include Microsoft Distributable Code in
                    malicious, deceptive, or unlawful programs.
    Further, you will require end users of the Microsoft Distributable
    Code to agree to terms at least as protective as this ELA.

    third party licenses will govern. By agreeing to the terms of this ELA,
    you also agree to the terms of such licenses.

7)  Restrictions

7A) You may make one (1) copy of the Software in machine-readable form,
    solely for archival or backup purposes, provided the copyright notice

    copied onto another individual or legal entity's computer except as
    expressly provided in this ELA. The Software is licensed as a single
    product.

7B) The term "proprietary" as used in this ELA or in the Software does
    not establish a confidential relationship between the Licensor and
    you and does not in itself provide you any rights to the Software.
    You acknowledge that the Licensors have valuable intellectual
    property rights in the Software and agree to respect and protect such
    intellectual property rights. No right, title, or interest in or to
    any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of the Licensors is
    granted under this ELA.

7C) You acknowledge and agree that the Software is not designed, manufactured
    or intended for use in connection with the design, construction,
    maintenance, and/or operation of any system or application where the use or
    failure of such system or application could result in a situation that
    threatens the safety of human life or results in catastrophic damages
    (including, for example, in on-line control equipment in hazardous
    environments such as nuclear activities, aircraft navigation or control, or
    life support systems). The Licensors disclaim any express or implied 
    warranty of fitness for such uses. NVIDIA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY
    THIRD PARTY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
    SUCH USES.

7D) You will not use the Software so that any part of it becomes subject to an
    Excluded License. As used in this ELA, an "Excluded License" is one that
    requires, as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution, that
    (i)     the Software be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
    (ii)    others have a right to modify it, or 
    (iii)   the Software becomes redistributable at no charge, or
    (iv)    the Software loses its proprietary nature.

7E) Under no circumstances should anything in this ELA be construed as NVIDIA
    granting by implication, estoppel or otherwise, (i) a license to any
    NVIDIA product or technology other than the Software; or (ii) any
    additional license rights for the Software other than the licenses
    expressly granted in this ELA.

8)  Feedback

    You may, but are not obligated to, provide NVIDIA any suggestions,
    comments and feedback regarding the Software delivered to you hereunder
    ("Feedback").  NVIDIA and its affiliates may use and include any Feedback
    that you have voluntarily provided to improve the Software and other
    NVIDIA products or technologies.  Accordingly, if you provide Feedback,
    you grant NVIDIA and its affiliates and their licensees a perpetual,
    irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license grant to freely
    use, have used, sell, modify, reproduce, transmit, license, sublicense
    (through multiple tiers of sublicensees), distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors), and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the
    Software and other products or technologies.

    LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF
    THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION REMAINS WITH 
    YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
    THE LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT,
    SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER
    PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THIS ELA OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
    USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TO THE
    EXTENT THAT NVIDIA MAY BE HELD LEGALLY LIABLE TO YOU BY A COURT OF
    COMPETENT JURISDICTION UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
    THEORY, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF THE LICENSORS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE
    APPLICABLE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
    (US$1,000), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

    NVIDIA has no obligation to support or provide any updates of the
    Software.

    You agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining appropriate data
    backups and system restore points for Target Systems.

10) Indemnity and Audit

    You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold the Licensors harmless from

    settlements, and costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
    reasonable attorneys' fees and court or arbitration costs), asserted
    by any and all third parties (collectively "Claims") against the
    Licensors, and their respective employees, directors, officers, and
    agents alleging or resulting from:
    (i)     your breach of any term or condition of this ELA;

            other proprietary rights of a third party by you or your
            Sublicensees; unauthorized alteration of the Software or
            derivative products by you or your Sublicensees;
    (iii)   combination of the Software or derivative products with other

            officers, and agents or Sublicensees either under this ELA or
            outside its scope, including personal injury, death, or
            property damage to anyone or anything.
