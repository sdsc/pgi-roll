********************
*  1 Introduction  *
********************
    
This document provides the information required to successfully 
install PGI Workstation or PGI Server in a generic manner on Linux. 
If you use these instructions for installation, you do not need to 
run a license daemon, except as noted in these instructions.  
    
Before you begin the installation, it is essential that you understand 
the flow of the installation process.  There are basically three stages 
of the workstation installation process:
    
1.) Prepare to install. 
    Verify that you have all the required information and software.
2.) Install the software.
    Install the software appropriate for your operating system.
3.) License the software.
    Install the licenses and start the license server.
The remainder of this document provides the steps and specific actions
to take to complete these steps.

***************** 
*  2 Licensing  * 
*****************

Although licensing is the final stage indicated in the previous steps, 
it is essential that you understand your licensing choices.
    
The PGI Workstation compilers and tools are license-managed.  There are 
two types of license keys: trial and permanent. This section describes 
the generation of these license keys. 
    
Note: You must install the software before you obtain your license
because the licensing request prompts you for information that is 
generated during the software installation.
    
You generate license keys by logging in to your PGI web-user account at
       www.pgroup.com/webuser/login.php
You can generate either a trial or permanent license key. 
    
o  Permanent keys: When your order is processed, a PGI web-user account 
   is created automatically, if necessary, and the e-mail order 
   acknowledgement you receive includes complete instructions for
   logging on at the URL listed above. You then generate permanent
   license keys using this account.
    
o  Trial keys: When you register for a trial, your PGI web-user account 
   is created and you can log in at the URL listed above to generate
   you should generate trial keys.

Now look at specific licensing issues. 

2.1 PGI Workstation Licensing
    
PGI Workstation is node-locked to a single system in a way that allows
any user of the system to use the PGI compilers and tools.   However, 
only a single user is allowed to run any of the PGI compilers or tools
at a given time.
    
2.2 PGI Server Licensing
    
PGI Server supports multi-user, network-floating licenses. Multiple users
can use the PGI compilers and tools simultaneously from multiple systems 
on a network when those systems have a properly configured version of 
PGI Server installed. The number of seats purchased for the license 
determines the limitation on the number of concurrent users.
    
On Linux, PGI Server may be installed locally on each machine on a 
network or may be installed once on a shared file system available to 
each machine. If you choose the second method, a network install, adding
another machine to the group running the compilers is a much simpler 
process. You merely adjust to the unique characteristics of the newly 
added system with a customization script that must be executed on each 
machine in the group.

2.3 The FLEXnet License Manager
    
PGI Workstation and PGI Server software licensing is managed using the 
FLEXnet license management system from Macrovision.  As part of the 
process of installing the PGI compilers and tools in the following 
sections, you will install and configure the FLEXnet license management
software.  These sections describe how to configure license daemons for 
Linux, including installation and start-up of the license daemon, and 
proper initialization of the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable.

2.4 Trial Licensing Key Constraints
                             NOTE
     At the conclusion of the trial period, the PGI compilers
     and tools and any executable files generated prior to the 
     installation of permanent license keys will cease to function.
     Any executables, object files, or libraries created using the
     PGI compilers in demo mode must be recompiled with permanent
     license keys in place.

2.5 Licensing Keys and System Configurations
    
Executable files generated with permanent license keys in place are 
unconstrained, and run on any compatible system, regardless of 
whether the PGI compilers are installed. 
    
If you change the configuration of your system by adding or removing 
hardware, your license key may become invalid. Please contact The 
Portland Group if you expect to reconfigure your system to ensure that 
you do not temporarily lose the use of the PGI compilers and tools.

******************************************* 
*  3 Installing on Linux86 or Linux86-64  * 
*******************************************
    
This section describes how to install PGI Workstation or PGI Server on 
a Linux system.  It covers local and network installs and is applicable 
to permanent or trial installations.

-- For installation on 32-bit x86 processor-based systems, the PGI 
   Workstation installation script installs only the linux86 versions 
   of the PGI compilers and tools. 
    
-- For installations on 64-bit x64 systems running a linux86-64 
   execution and development environment, the PGI installation script 
   installs linux86-64 version of the PGI compilers and tools. 

-- If the 32-bit gcc development package is already installed on the 
   system, the 32-bit linux86 tools are also installed on a 64-bit x64 
   system.
      
If the user specifies /opt/pgi as the base directory for installation,
the PGI install script creates the following directory structure:
    
Note. Those familiar with releases of PGI Workstation for Linux prior 
to release 5.0 should note that the installation directory structure has
changed.  The path to the PGI Workstation 13.2 Release compilers must be
modified accordingly.

Additionally, a network install creates the following directories:

Name of directory                   Contents 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
/opt/pgi/linux86/13.2/lib-linux86-g	linux86 32-bit libpgc library

                                      or gcc installed on each machine
    
3.1 Preparing to Install
    
Note. For Linux installations, each user must also set their environment
variables properly to access the software, as described later in section
3.3: End-user Environment Settings on Linux.
    
The 32-bit and 64-bit compilers, tools, and supporting components have 
the same command names.  Further, the environment you target by default 
(linux86-64 or linux86) depends on the version of the compiler that 
comes first in your path settings.
    
In a traditional local installation, the default installation base 
directory is /opt/pgi.  If you choose to perform a network install, you 
should specify a shared file system for the installation base directory. 
You must also specify a second directory name that is local to each of 
the systems where the PGI compilers and tools are used.  This local 
directory will contain the libraries to use when compiling and running 
on that machine.  This approach allows a network installation to support
a network of machines that run different versions of Linux.
    
To prepare for the installation, do the following:    
    
1 Locate the email that contains your Order Acknowledgement. 
  This email contains instructions on how to download the PGI software
  from the PGI web page as well as the PIN number associated with your
  licensing file.
    
2 Bring up a shell command window on your system.  
  The installation instructions assume you are using csh, sh, ksh, bash, 
  or some compatible shell. If you are using a shell that is not 
  compatible with one of these shells, appropriate modifications are 
  necessary when setting environment variables.
    
3 Verify you have enough free disk space. 
  -- In the linux86 platform, PGI installation requires 250 MB of free 
     disk space. 
  -- On the linux86-64 platform, PGI installation requires 500 MB of 
     free disk space.
    
Once you prepare for the installation of PGI Workstation or PGI Server 
on Linux, you are ready to perform the required steps to install. 
However, before looking at the details of the installation process, 
take a quick look at the stages of the process:
    
    1.) Unpack the PGI Software.
    2.) Run the install script.
    3.) Make PGI products accessible and prepare for licensing.
    4.) Verify the release number of the installed software.
    5.) Generate and install license keys.
    6.) Start the license manager daemon.
    7.) Review the documentation.
    8.) Complete network installation tasks.  (If Network install)

3.2 Installing PGI Workstation or PGI Server

=================================
Step 1 - Unpack the PGI Software.
=================================
    
- If you received this software on a CD-ROM, locate the CD-ROM and then
  skip to step 2.
- If you downloaded the software from http://www.pgroup.com or another 
  electronic distribution site, then in the instructions that follow, 
  replace <tarfile> with the name of the file that was downloaded.

  NOTE: The PGI products cannot be installed into the same directory 
  where the tar file is unpacked.  Use the following command sequence
  to unpack the tar file into a temporary directory before installation:
      
        % mkdir /tmp/pgi
        % mv <tarfile>.tar.gz /tmp/pgi
        % cd /tmp/pgi
        % tar xpfz <tarfile>.tar.gz
    
  While all software should fit into less than 150 MB of disk space, 
  we stated earlier that approximately 250 MB for 32-bit or 500 MB for 
  linux86-64 are required as disk space during installation.  You can 
  recover 100MB of the required disk space by deleting the tar file 
  after installation is complete. 

================================
Step 2 - Run the install script.
================================

Note. The install script must be run to properly install the software.
     
- If you are installing from a CD-ROM, issue the following command:
       % /mnt/cdrom/install
    
- If you downloaded the software from the Internet, execute the 
  following script in the directory where you unpacked the tar file:
        % ./install

You will be asked to assent to the PGI end-user license agreement 
(EULA), whether to perform a traditional local installation or a network
installation, whether to install the optional ACML math library from AMD,
and where to place the installation directory.  After the software is 
installed, the install script performs some system-specific customization
and then initializes the licensing.
    
NOTE: For a network installation, you are asked for a common local 
directory. This local directory is created once on each system utilizing
the network installation. Further, it must be created on each system 
before adding that system to the network using the compilers.
    
NOTE:  If you have difficulty running this script, especially on a 
Slackware Linux system, check the permissions on /dev/null. Permissions
should be set to "crw-rw-rw-".  If necessary, reset permissions to this
value. To do this, super-user permissions are required.
    
NOTE: Some systems use a CD-ROM volume manager that may insert an 
additional directory in the above pathname, and require the longer 
pathname. For example, you may need to execute a script like this:
       % /cdrom/pgisoft/install    
If you are not sure how to access the CD-ROM drive, check with your 
system administrator.

At the end of the installation, the install script prints a message 
similar to this:

  To obtain an evaluation license, go to: 
      www.pgroup.com/webuser/login.php  
  and use your web-user access codes (email address and 
  password) and the information below to generate a trial 
  license.

  For a permanent license, please read the order 
  acknowledgement that you received.  Connect to        
      www.pgroup.com/webuser/login.php  
  with the username and password provided in the order 
  acknowledgement.

      FLEXlm hostid: <your host id>
      Hostname: <your host name>
      Installation: /opt/pgi
      PGI Release: 13.2

You need this FLEXlm hostid and Hostname in Step 3. Should you need
to retrieve this information at a later time, the preceding message
is also saved to the file /opt/pgi/license.info, where /opt/pgi is 
the installation directory. 
 
================================================================
Step 3 - Make PGI products accessible and Prepare for Licensing.
================================================================

When install script has completed, execute the following commands 
to make the PGI products accessible and to initialize your 
environment for use of FLEXnet. 

For linux86-64:
--------------
To use the linux86-64 version of the compilers and tools, execute 
the following commands, assuming you have installed in the default
/opt/pgi directory. 

For csh:

  % setenv PGI /opt/pgi
  % set path=(/opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.2/bin $path)
  % setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH":/opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.2/man
  % setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE "$LM_LICENSE_FILE":/opt/pgi/license.dat 

For bash, sh or ksh:

  $ PATH=/opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.2/bin:$PATH
  $ export PATH 
  $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.2/man
  $ export MANPATH
  $ LM_LICENSE_FILE=$LM_LICENSE_FILE:/opt/pgi/license.dat
  $ export LM_LICENSE_FILE


For linux86:
-----------
To use only the linux86 version of the compilers and tools, or to
target linux86 as the default, use a setup similar to the previous one,
changing the path settings as illustrated in the following commands.

For csh:
	   
  % setenv PGI /opt/pgi
  % set path=(/opt/pgi/linux86/13.2/bin $path)
  % setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH":/opt/pgi/linux86/13.2/man
  % setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE "$LM_LICENSE_FILE":/opt/pgi/license.dat  
 
For bash, sh or ksh:

  $ PATH=/opt/pgi/linux86/13.2/bin:$PATH
  $ export PATH 
  $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/pgi/linux86/13.2/man
  $ export MANPATH
  $ LM_LICENSE_FILE=$LM_LICENSE_FILE:/opt/pgi/license.dat
  $ export LM_LICENSE_FILE

You should add these commands to your shell startup files to ensure 
that you have access to the PGI products upon future logins.


============================================================
Step 4.	Verify the Release Number of the Installed Software.
============================================================

To verify the release number of the products you have installed, 
use the ?V option on any of the compiler commands, as illustrated 
in the following examples.  If you use –v instead, you also see 
the sequence of steps the compiler will use to compile and link 
programs for execution on your system. 
 
-  For Fortran 77, use:   pgf77 -V x.f
-  For Fortran 95, use:   pgf95 -V x.f
-  For HPF, use:          pghpf -V x.f
-  For C++, use:          pgCC –V x.c
-  For ANSI C, use:       pgcc -V x.c

Note. These commands can be successfully executed even if the 
files x.f or x.c do not exist and you have not completed the 
licensing phase of the installation.  The PGI compiler drivers 
support this as a quick check that you have installed the proper 
version of the compilers and have initialized your environment 
to enable access to that version. 


==========================================
Step 5. Generate and Install License Keys.
==========================================

All of the PGI compilers and tools are license-managed and require
installation of license keys to make the PGI software operational.  

To obtain license keys, you need the following information:
-  A PGI web-user username and password.  
   You use these to log on at www.pgroup.com/webuser/login.php and 
   generate your license keys.  
   -- If you received an Order Acknowledgment corresponding to a 
      permanent license, an account was created automatically when 
      the order was entered.  The username for the account is the 
      email address to which the order acknowledgment was sent. A 
      separate email was sent to that same address including the 
      password for the account.  
   -- If you registered for a trial of the PGI software, you created
      your PGI web-user account at the time you registered and 
      received your password in a subsequent e-mail.
-  The FLEXlm hostid and hostname of the computer on which the software
   is installed, which is echoed to your screen by the install script.

Note. You can also obtain your FLEXlm hostid by using the following 
command after you have executed the install script:
   
           % lmutil lmhostid


To Generate License Keys:

Once you have logged on on at www.pgroup.com/webuser/login.php using 
your PGI web-user email and password, you see a Welcome screen.


To generate permanent license keys:
     a.	Click Create permanent keys.
     b.	Click the PIN associated with the product for which you wish
        to generate license keys.
     c.	Click License keys to generate the keys.

To generate trial license keys:
     a.	Click Create trial keys.
     b.	Accept the terms of the agreement.
     c.	Enter the hostid exactly as it appears in the message that 
        is displayed during installation.
     d.	Click the Generate license key button. 
 
Install License Keys
-------------------

Once you have generated your trial or permanent license keys, copy and
paste them into the file /opt/pgi/license.dat, or substitute the appropriate installation directory path if you have not installed in 
the default /opt/pgi directory. 

For example, if you have purchased PGI Fortran Workstation for Linux, the 
license.dat file should look similar to the following:

  SERVER <hostname> <hostid> 27000

In your license file:
-- <hostid> should match the hostid you submitted above when you 
   generated your license keys.
-- If necessary, you can enter or edit the <hostname> entry 
   manually. You cannot edit the <hostid> entry or you invalidate 
   the license keys.  
-- The six digits immediately following the = in the feature line
   component, VENDOR_STRING=107209:8 represent the Product ID 
   Number (PIN) for this installation, in this example 107209.  
   You have a similar unique PIN number for your installation. 
 
Note. Please include your PIN number when sending mail to us 
regarding technical support for the products you have purchased. 
This PIN number is also on your order acknowledgement email.

=========================================
Step 6.	Start the license manager daemon.
========================================= 

Important: If you are evaluating PGI Workstation with trial keys, you 
do not need to perform this step and can proceed to Step 7.

Note. The following refers to the shell script template for linux86-64. 
If you have installed only linux86, please substitute linux86 for 
linux86-64. 

If you installed the compilers in a directory other than /opt/pgi, edit
the shell script template $PGI/linux86-64/13.2/bin/lmgrd.rc and substitute
the correct installation directory for /opt/pgi in the section of the 
script entitled: "Where to find the PGI Software." Then save the file and 
exit the editor.
 
Issue the following command to start the license server and pgroupd 
license daemon running on your system:

        % lmgrd.rc start

If you wish to stop the license server and license daemon at a later time,
you can do so with the command:
        
        % lmgrd.rc stop

To make sure that the license server and pgroupd daemon are started each 
time your system is booted, log in as root, set the PGI environment 
variable as described in Step 4 above, and then execute the following 
two commands:

        % cp $PGI/linux86/13.2/bin/lmgrd.rc  /etc/init.d/lmgrd   
        % ln -s /etc/init.d/lmgrd  /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S90lmgrd

Note. You must be logged in as root to successfully execute these commands,
and there are two values in this example that may be different on your 
system:

-  Your system’s default runlevel may be something other than ‘3’, the 
   level used in this example. You can run /sbin/runlevel to check the 
   system’s runlevel. If the runlevel on your systems is different, then 
   you must set the correct subdirectory; use your system’s runlevel in 
   place of the “3” in the preceding example. 

-  Your rc files may be in a directory other than the one in the example:
   /etc/init.d. If the rc files are in a directory such as /etc/rc.d/init.d,
   then substitute that location in the example.

Most Linux distributions include the chkconfig(8) utility that manages the
runlevel scripts.  If your system has this tool and you wish to use it, 
then run the following commands:

        % cp $PGI/linux86/13.2/bin/lmgrd.rc /etc/rc.d/init.d/
        % chkconfig --add lmgrd.rc

The appropriate links will be created in the /etc/rc.d directory hierarchy.
For more information on chkconfig, please see the manual page.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Release 13.2 includes a newer version of the Macrovision 
FLEXnet software. The updated lmgrd and pgroupd daemons must be used in 
preference to versions shipped with previous releases of the PGI products.  
You can co-install Release 13.2 with Release 12.x, 11.x, and older; and 
you can use any of these versions of the compilers and tools with the new 
versions of lmgrd and pgroupd and a single Release 13.2 license file.  
Further, if you use this file to start lmgrd automatically after a reboot 
of your system, you must modify your lmgrd.rc file in the /etc/rc.d or 
/etc/init.d directory to use the new lmgrd.  

For example, your lmgrd.rc file may look like this one, where <target> 
is replaced appropriately with linux86 or linux86-64.
	   
        ## Path to master daemon lmgrd
        # Commented out previous path to 12.10:
        #LMGRD=$PGI/<target>/12.10/bin/lmgrd
        LMGRD=$PGI/<target>/13.2/bin/lmgrd
        
        ## Command to stop lmgrd 
        #Commented out previous path to 12.10: 
        #LMUTIL=$PGI/<target>/12.10/bin/lmutil 
        LMUTIL=$PGI/<target>/13.2/bin/lmutil

==============================
Step 7 - Review Documentation.
==============================
    
You can view the online HTML and PDF documentation using any web browser
by opening the file:

        $PGI/linux86-64/13.2/doc/index.htm
or
        $PGI/linux86/13.2/doc/index.htm

    
You may want to bookmark this location for easy future reference to the
online manuals.

=============================================    
Step 8 - Complete Network Installation Tasks.
=============================================
    
Skip this step if you are not using a network installation.
    
For a network installation, you must run the local installation script 
on each system on the network where the compilers and tools will be 
available for use. 
     
If your installation base directory is /opt/pgi and the common local 
directory is /usr/pgi/shared/13.2, run the following commands on each 
system on the network.  
    
      /opt/pgi/linux86/13.2/bin/makelocalrc \
         -x /opt/pgi/linux86/13.2 \
         -net /usr/pgi/shared/13.2

      /opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.2/bin/makelocalrc \
         -x /opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.2 \
         -net /usr/pgi/shared/13.2
      
These commands create a system-dependent file localrc.machinename in 
both the /opt/pgi/linux86/13.2/bin directory and in 
/opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.2/bin. The commands also create the following 
three directories containing libraries and shared objects specific to 
the operating system and system libraries on that machine:
/usr/pgi/shared/13.2/lib, /usr/pgi/shared/13.2/liblf, and 
/usr/pgi/shared/13.2/lib64.
      
NOTE.  The makelocalrc command does allow the flexibility to have local
directories that have different names on different machines.  However, 
using the same directory on different machines allows users to easily 
move executables that use PGI-supplied shared libraries between systems.

Installation of the PGI products for Linux is now complete. 
 

3.3 End-user Environment Settings on Linux
-----------------------------------------_

Now that you have installed the compilers in, for example, /opt/pgi, 
you must initialize your environment to use the compilers successfully. 
Assume the license file is in /opt/pgi/license.dat, and the lmgrd 
license manager is running.  
      
NOTE. Each user must issue the following sequence of commands to 
initialize the shell environment before using the PGI compilers and 
tools.      

64-bit Compiler Commands
------------------------      
The following commands make the 64-bit compilers the default.

      
In csh, use these commands:

    % setenv PGI /opt/pgi
    % setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH":$PGI/linux86-64/13.2/man
    % setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE $PGI/license.dat
    % set path = ($PGI/linux86-64/13.2/bin $path)
 
Once the 64-bit compilers are the defaults, you can make MPICH commands
and MPICH man pages accessible using these csh commands.

    % set path = ($PGI/linux86-64/13.2/mpi/mpich/bin $path)
    % setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH":$PGI/linux86-64/13.2/mpi/mpich/man

     
In bash, sh or ksh, use these commands:

    $ PGI=/opt/pgi; export PGI 
    $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:$PGI/linux86-64/13.2/man
    $ export MANPATH 
    $ LM_LICENSE_FILE=$PGI/license.dat 
    $ export LM_LICENSE_FILE 
    $ PATH=$PGI/linux86-64/13.2/bin:$PATH 
    $ export PATH

Once the 64-bit compilers are the defaults, you can make MPICH commands
and MPICH man pages accessible using these commands.

    $ PATH=$PGI/linux86-64/13.2/mpi/mpich/bin:$PATH
    $ export PATH
    $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:$PGI/linux86-64/13.2/mpi/mpich/man
    $ export MANPATH 

      
32-bit Compiler Commands
------------------------
The following commands make the 32-bit compilers the default.
       
In csh, use these commands:

    % setenv PGI /opt/pgi
    % setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH":$PGI/linux86/13.2/man
    % setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE $PGI/license.dat
    % set path = ($PGI/linux86/13.2/bin $path)

Once the 32-bit compilers are the defaults, you can make MPICH 
commands and MPICH man pages accessible using these csh commands.

  To access the MPICH commands, execute this command line:
    % set path = ($PGI/linux86/13.2/mpi/mpich/bin $path)

  To access the MPICH man pages, execute this command line:
    % setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH":$PGI/linux86/13.2/mpi/mpich/man

      
In bash, sh or ksh, use these commands:

    $ PGI=/opt/pgi; export PGI 
    $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:$PGI/linux86/13.2/man
    $ export MANPATH 
    $ LM_LICENSE_FILE=$PGI/license.dat 
    $ export LM_LICENSE_FILE 
    $ PATH=$PGI/linux86/13.2/bin:$PATH 
    $ export PATH 

Once the 32-bit compilers are the defaults, you can make MPICH 
commands and MPICH man pages accessible using these commands.

    $ PATH=$PGI/linux86/13.2/mpi/mpich/bin:$PATH
    $ export PATH
    $ MANPATH= $MANPATH:$PGI/linux86/13.2/mpi/mpich/man
    $ export MANPATH
